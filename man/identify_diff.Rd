\title{Identify posterior mean differences}
\usage{
identify_diff(posterior, CI_level = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{posterior}{A tibble, typically coming from a \code{posterior_mean()}
function, containing the parameters of the multivariate posterior
t-distributions for the mean of the considered groups and draws for each
peptide.}

\item{CI_level}{A number, defining the order of quantile chosen to assess
differences between groups.}
}
\value{
A tibble, indicating which peptides and groups seem to be different
}
\description{
Compute a criterion based on Credible Intervals (CI) to determine whether
the posterior t-distributions of groups should be considered different enough
to deserve further examination. Two groups are considered probably 'distinct'
if the Credible Interval of level \code{CI_level} of their respective
posterior t-distributions do not overlap.
